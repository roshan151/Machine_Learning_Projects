##[Multiclass Classification](https://github.com/roshan151/roshan151/blob/main/Multiclass_classification_for_Computer_Vision.ipynb) 
Multiclass classification is a convolutional neural network model that classifies images with hand signals into 25 different classes. Model Architecture consists of 2 convolutional and max pooling layers, 1 dropout layer to avoid overfitting, 1 dense layer with 514 neurons and a final dense layer with 25 neurons and softmax.
