**Computer Vision**

[Multiclass Classification](https://github.com/roshan151/roshan151/blob/main/Multiclass_classification_for_Computer_Vision.ipynb) is a convolutional neural network model that classifies images with hand signals into 25 different classes. Model architecture consists of 2 convolutional and max pooling layers, 1 dropout layer to avoid overfitting, 1 dense layer with 514 neurons and a final dense layer with 25 neurons and softmax. 

[Transfer Learning](https://github.com/roshan151/roshan151/blob/main/Transfer_Learning_for_Computer_Vision.ipynb) is a computer vision model which uses imported weights from a state of the art computer vision model - InceptionV3. All the layers of InceptionV3 model are set to untrainable except for the last. Then a final DNN architecture is added with a dense layer of 1024 neuron, a dropout layer and a final dense layer with 1 neuron and sigmoid activation to classify colored images of humans and horses.
